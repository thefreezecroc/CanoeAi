CanoeAi is a project designed to collect and analyze data from sensors placed in a canoe paddle to understand movement dynamics. The system uses Arduino Nano 33 BLE and IMU sensors to gather motion data, which is processed using Python scripts.

## Features
- Data collection using IMU sensors
- Motion analysis for canoeing technique improvement
- Python scripts for data processing

## Requirements
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- IMU Sensor
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/thefreezecroc/CanoeAi`
2. Upload Arduino code to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
3. Run Python scripts to process the collected data.

## Folders
- **ArduinoCode**: Contains code for the Arduino board.
- **PythonCodes**: Scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- **TestCodes**: Code for testing and calibration.

## Usage
1. Place the Arduino Nano with the IMU sensor inside the paddle.
2. Start the data collection process using the Arduino.
3. Analyze the collected data using Python scripts.
